# Store Locator Fix Summary

## Issues Found

The store locator was **completely broken** and not using the search radius slider at all. Here's what was wrong:

### 1. **Frontend Issues (Locator.tsx)**
   - ❌ The `searchRadius` slider state existed but was **never sent to the API**
   - ❌ The search query didn't include the radius parameter
   - ❌ The search would not re-trigger when the user changed the slider

### 2. **Backend Issues (search.py)**
   - ❌ The `/search` endpoint didn't accept `latitude`, `longitude`, or `radius` parameters
   - ❌ Even though the Yelp client had a `search_nearby()` method with radius support, it was never being used
   - ❌ All location-based searches were falling back to generic searches without radius constraints

### 3. **API Integration Issues (queries.ts)**
   - ❌ The `useSearchRestaurants` hook didn't have a `radius` parameter defined
   - ❌ No way to pass radius from frontend to backend

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Backend Changes (search.py)**
   - ✅ Added `latitude`, `longitude`, and `radius` parameters to the `/search` endpoint
   - ✅ Added logic to detect when a location-based search is requested (lat/lng + radius)
   - ✅ Integrated the `search_nearby()` method from the Yelp client for radius-based searches
   - ✅ The search now correctly sends SQL-like queries to Yelp with the exact radius specified

### 2. **Frontend Changes (queries.ts)**
   - ✅ Added `radius` parameter to the `useSearchRestaurants` hook
   - ✅ The radius is now properly passed to the backend API

### 3. **Component Changes (Locator.tsx)**
   - ✅ The `searchRadius` slider value is now passed to the search query
   - ✅ Because the radius is in the `queryKey`, React Query will automatically re-fetch when it changes
   - ✅ Fixed linter warning about unused `error` variable

## How It Works Now

1. **User opens Locator page** → Browser requests geolocation permission
2. **Location detected** → Frontend gets lat/lng coordinates
3. **User adjusts radius slider** → State updates (e.g., 5km → 21km)
4. **Search query triggers** → Sends `latitude`, `longitude`, and `radius` to backend
5. **Backend routes correctly** → Uses `search_nearby()` with exact radius
6. **Yelp API called** → Queries restaurants within the specified radius in meters
7. **Results displayed** → Map shows restaurants within the radius + list below

## Testing Instructions

1. Start the backend and frontend servers
2. Navigate to the Locator page
3. Allow location access when prompted
4. You should see your location on the map
5. **Adjust the radius slider** (5km → 10km → 20km, etc.)
6. The search should **automatically re-trigger** and show different results
7. Restaurants on the map should appear/disappear based on the radius

## API Flow

```
Frontend Locator Component
  ↓ (searchRadius: 21000 meters)
  ↓
useSearchRestaurants Hook
  ↓ (latitude, longitude, radius)
  ↓
Backend /search Endpoint
  ↓ (checks if lat/lng/radius all present)
  ↓
yelp_client.search_nearby()
  ↓ (sends to Yelp API with radius constraint)
  ↓
Yelp API Response
  ↓ (restaurants within radius)
  ↓
Display on Map + List
```

## Key Changes Summary

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `backend/app/routers/search.py` | Added `latitude`, `longitude`, `radius` params; integrated `search_nearby()` |
| `frontend/src/lib/queries.ts` | Added `radius` parameter to search hook |
| `frontend/src/components/Locator.tsx` | Pass `searchRadius` to API; fixed linter warning |

## Why It Didn't Work Before

The slider was essentially a **UI placebo** - it looked like it did something, but the value was never actually used. The backend had no way to accept a radius parameter, and even if it did, it wasn't configured to use the correct Yelp API method that supports radius-based searches.

Now, the slider is **fully functional** and the search results will change in real-time as you adjust it!
